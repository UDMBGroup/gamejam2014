the corpse
-It's Uncle Bigglesworth's dead body. It looks like he was hit in the back of the head...
-*sniff* Mr.Bigglesworth *sniff* Wait is that a cheeto stain on his collar?
-Poor Mr.Bigglesworth. He was good man. What happened here? What was the purpose?

scotch glass
-
-
-It's a half empty glass of scotch, Mr.Bigglesworth favorite drink. Maybe he was poisoned?. Better not drink that!

poison book
-Uncle Bigglesworth sure did love books. i wonder how many of these he actually read? "Household Chemicals and Ways to Kill with Them", "Falling Up, Standing Down: A Memoir of a Sad Clown", "Castles and Princesses: A Knight's Tale"... hmmm...

snacks
-
-This detective work is making me hungry! Alright lets see here, there's pretzels, pepsi, and an opened bag of cheetos that John brought. He's the only one that likes them...
-

portrait
-
-
-It's a portrait of Mr. Bigglesworth... It's signed S.V... Scarlet Velvet, perhaps? I knew they had something going on behind the scenes! I bet she killed him for his money!

cable
-
-This cable looks a little disheveled... I wonder if he was strangled?! Those cheeto stains near his collar... hmmm...
-

the purse
-
-Looks like Annie left it here last night. Hmmm... Let's see what Mrs. N. keeps in here anyway. OMG, she hid one of the gold candlesticks in here. Stealing?! That doesn't seem like Annie... Is that blood?!
-

computer
- Let's just go ahead and take a look at his email... maybe there'll be a clue. *hacking commences* Ahah! How to get rich quick! Let me just forward that to my email...
-There's a very angry email here from a cutiepieD35@quickmail.com... who's that?
-

paper scrap
-
-
-No my God! A scrap of paper with a 3 on it... Half-Life 3 confirmed! I bet John killed Mr. B. because he wouldn't let John play! Or it's just a piece of trash... Who can know for sure?

missing weapon
-There looks like there should be a weapon in this statues hands... A sword, maybe? Where did it go?
-
-

manuscript
-
-A manuscript by Annie N. Looks like Mr. Bigglesworth didn't like her ideas. It's all marked up! I doubt she liked that... OMG, Annie's email address is cutiepieD35@quickmail.com! I am so making fun of her for this!
-

book
-
-It's Mr. Bigglesworth's journal... Looks like him and John haven't been getting along recently. I wonder if it has to do with inheriting the Bigglesworth fortune.
-

cabinets
-
-
-The cabinet is ajar... and some of these chemicals look like they may have been moved around. Bleach and all kinds of cleaning products... hmmm... definitely not non-toxic.

candles
-I'm sure there was a second candlestick here last night at dinner. Where did it go? I remember Annie in particular was interested in Uncle Bigglesworth's gold candlesticks...
-
-

chair
-You know... last night at dinner I thought I felt a little tension between Annie and Mr. Bigglesworth... then again I did have a few drinks... hmmm...
-Last night's dinner was great. Sooo delicious. It seemed like Annie was being a little cold towards Mr. Bigglesworth, though...
-I thought I saw some weird looks between Scarlet and Mr. Bigglesworth last night at dinner... I wonder...

knives
-A knife?! That's used for cutting things!
-This is a nice knife. It looks like one of those knives you could cut a pineapple straight through with.
-I don't think Mr. Bigglesworth was stabbed. I didn't see any knife wounds.

leftovers
-
-
-This is Mr. Bigglesworth's plate. He was the only one who ate dessert... everyone else was full... hmmm...

pots
-
-
-*sniff* Bleach? Or is it just the thyme? I was never a good cook. Scarlet is the cook... hmmm...

scuffs
-Looks like comething was dragged through here... hmmm...
-These scuff marks lead from the kitchen...
-Someone needs to clean this place better.

programmer
-
-John seems to be in deep thought. Probably thinking about binary numbers and stuff like that... doesn't seem that choked up about his uncle though...
-John... He's a genius, but an evil genius? Maybe...

writer
-Annie... she is one of the best game story writers in the biz! I loved her work on Duty Calls: The War Cometh!
-Annie... such a weirdo. She seems nice and all, but something about her creeps me out!
