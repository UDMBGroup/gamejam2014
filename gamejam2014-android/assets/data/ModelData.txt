poison book
-It's a book about poison, written by Douglas Applesteen. One of the pages is dog-eared, and it looks like there is a little bit of nail polish in the book.

portrait
-

-This portrait looks vaguefully familiar...Oh my god he looks just like Mr.Bigglesworth! Holy crap he must be Mr.Bigglesworth father, and he looks loaded! Come to think of it, now that Mr.Bigglesworth is dead, who is going to inherit the mansion? Scarlett Velvet was getting pretty cosy with Mr.Bigglesworth. OMG Scarlett killed Mr.Bigglesworth so she could inherit the mansion! That jerk!
